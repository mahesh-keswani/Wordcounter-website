	This is my first website in <strong>Django</strong> :).<br/>
	This website basically takes the input from user as some long paragraph and returns the<br/>
	total number of words in the long text.<br/>
	In addition to that, it also returns all the unique words in the long text along with their
	<br/>number of occurences.
